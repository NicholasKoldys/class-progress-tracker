## WGU Project 2020
## Developed By : @NicholasKoldys

### Description
This project was developed for WGU's "MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPEMENT".  The purpose of the project invokes the practice of the android's activity lifecycle, methods of handling events, and is developed in the programming language **Java**.  It introduces a graphical user interface seperated into 3 sections, manipulation of terms, courses, and assessments.  Each type has its defined attributes/fields and can be joined or linked.  The application gives the user the ability to manipulate the observable data, sharing information, notetaking, and scheduling reminders. The application uses a file based database on the users device which invokes the basic CRUD principles, Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
